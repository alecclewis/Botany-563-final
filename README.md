This is my final project for Botany 563. My goal is to align and complete a phylogeny tree for leaf beetles and species of the genus: Gonioctena (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) based on allozyme data. All of my data is in the data_clean folder and my created trees are in the figures folder. Lastly, my reproducible script is in my notebook-log.md.
