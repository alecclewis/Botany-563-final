A phylogenetic analysis of the genus Gonioctena (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) based on allozyme data (17 loci) and mitochondrial DNA sequence data (three gene fragments, 1,391 sites) was performed to study the evolutionary history of host-plant shifts among these leaf beetles.

The diverse molecular data gathered in this study are to a large extent congruent, and
the analyses provide a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis to address questions about the
evolution of host-plant shifts in the genus Gonioctena. The most-parsimonious reconstruction of
the ancestral host-plant associations, based on the estimated phylogeny, suggests that the Fabaceae was the ancestral host-plant family of the genus.
